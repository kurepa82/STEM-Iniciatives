## Why does it matter to you?
Put shortly:
- If you advertise jobs - [the wording you use impacts who applies](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/10-ways-remove-gender-bias-job-listings/) (great candidates might be self-excluding).
- If you hire candidates - [the techniques you use impact who gets through](https://hbr.org/2017/06/7-practical-ways-to-reduce-bias-in-your-hiring-process) (you might not hire or promote the best candidates).
- If you intend to retain employees - [the culture of your organisation impacts who wants to stay](https://leanin.org/women-in-the-workplace-report-2022/were-in-the-midst-of-a-great-breakup) (including genuine inclusion of diversity and equitable opportunities).

Action on each of these matters is completely up to you, businesses are entitled to hire whoever and however they want!
But when systems aren't working in the businesses' interest, there's certainly more to it than altruism.

## Outsource!
It can be hard to know where to start, but you're not the first in wanting to implment a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program.

Trainers such as LifeLabs run sessions to highlight ways de-biasing improves your interview process (and how to do it at your company).
Get a program designed for your company [here](https://home.lifelabslearning.com/dei-programs), or attend an event for the public such as [this one](https://lifelabslearning.com/course/inclusive-interviewing-december-8-10-12pm-et/).
